# Homework-2
Bootstrap recreation homework

# Description
This is the second homework assignment in Bootcamp. We will be creating a "Portfolio" page with three specific pages. One defining the work within our portfolio, on containing a short description about ourselves. The third offering a page to comment on the site or to leave a message for the authour. But what differs from the first homework is that we are re-creating it using Bootstrap  code.

# Motivation

#Code style
We will be using Bootstrap, which is a CSS framework to use in order to achieve styling your website without writing individual code. Rather, it is more of a "copy and paste" opportunity to quickly make a website.
